Github Introduction::
===============

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, allowing developers to store and manage their code in repositories.

Version Control: ::
GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code. This allows multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's contributions.

Repositories::: where you can store your project files and track the history of changes made to those files.Public and private repos can be created depending on accessibility needs.



Git & Github Integration::
============================

Clone repository/Project from github to local machine steps::
==================================================================

Fork::
============

Fork means to make a copy of the repository into my own github account A fork is a copy of a repository


first we need to create the repository

Go to Repositories

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c295c1cb-8690-49db-93cf-766d695d0526)

Click New

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0ba9848-bb5c-461e-8f9b-c1cd332ab5dd)

Enter Repository Name

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cd6ae1c3-6160-4a5e-a159-5347469fb1b6)


select public

select Readmefile.md

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e631f9a4-eda5-4e93-8f31-629cda9e6d17)

Click Create Repository


Empty repository Created

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a838f321-7d0a-46a8-bc1c-e90d12ba5acf)


Now I'm Going to clone the Empty Repository from Remote to Local::
====================================================================
Steps::
=======



1.git clone git@github.com:srinfotechbatch4/hello-world-java.git

2.cd SRINfotechDemo

3.git status

4.git add --all

5.git status

6.git commit -m "i have added hellow world project files"

7.git push   ---->from local changes pushed to remote

8.git pull   --->remote to local

above steps to push some changes from Local to remote repository


Session Note::
===========

>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

>ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "srinfotechbatch4@gmail.com"

>git clone <URLof your project>

>git clone git@github.com:srinfotechbatch4/hello-world-java.git

>cd hello-world-java

>git status

>git add --all

>git status

>git commit -m "updated helloworld java file"

>git config --global user.email "srinfotechbatch4@gmail.com"
>git config --global user.name "srinfotechbatch4"

>git commit -m "updated helloworld java files"

>git push
